This runtime requires the `path` argument, specifying the path to the runtime engine. The `kv_cache_free_gpu_memory` is a convenient feature I have added, which internally uses the `kv_cache_free_gpu_memory_fraction` from the `TRT-LLM` framework, limiting the memory used by the model buffers. This is based on estimations to convert the absolute value to the *free_memory_fraction*, but is still more convenient than manually estimating the fraction ;)\n",

Another solution is to switch the `keras` backend to `pytorch`, but it is not always possible nor profitable. "
